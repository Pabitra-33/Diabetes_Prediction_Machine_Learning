Diabetes prediction using machine learning means using computer programs to guess if someone might get diabetes. 
These programs look at different things like your health history and lifestyle to make their guess. They learn from lots of examples of people with and without diabetes to make better guesses. For example, they might look at how much sugar someone eats or if they exercise regularly. By doing this, they can give early warnings to people who might be at risk of getting diabetes so they can take better care of themselves.

Diabetes, is a group of metabolic disorders in which there are high blood sugar levels over a prolonged period. Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.
