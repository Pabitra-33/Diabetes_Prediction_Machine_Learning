Data analysis: Here one will get to know about how the data analysis part is done in a data science life cycle.
Exploratory data analysis: EDA is one of the most important steps in the data science project life cycle and here one will need to know that how to make inferences from the visualizations and data analysis
Model building: Here we will be using 4 ML models and then we will choose the best performing model.
Saving model: Saving the best model using pickle to make the prediction from real data.

Diabetes prediction using machine learning means using computer programs to guess if someone might get diabetes. 
These programs look at different things like your health history and lifestyle to make their guess. They learn from lots of examples of people with and without diabetes to make better guesses. For example, they might look at how much sugar someone eats or if they exercise regularly. By doing this, they can give early warnings to people who might be at risk of getting diabetes so they can take better care of themselves.
